# ExoplanetML: Exoplanet Target Variable Prediction using Machine Learning 

This app allow users to build a machine learning (ML) model for Exoplanet target variable prediction in an end-to-end workflow. This encompasses data upload, data pre-processing, ML model building and post-model analysis. The user might need to do some a priori data curation.

## How to Use:

To work with the app, go to the sidebar: 1. Select a dataset (if you are uploading your own csv, it might require a bit of curation. Make sure the target variable is the last column and the file contains features relevant for the prediction); 2. Adjust the model parameters using the slider widgets. As a result, this would initiate the ML model building process, display the model results as well as allowing users to download the generated models and accompanying data.

## Google Colab

This google colab contains graphs of the Earth Similarity Index against the first 5 features to gain insights from the relationship between the ESI and the particular features. Aditionally the top 10 exoplanets with the highest ESI are also highlighted so that we can analyze any similar features amongst the most earth like exoplanets. <br>
